# Thinking of You

A web application for couples (including polyamorous relationships) to non-verbally signal "I'm thinking of you".

## Features
- **User Accounts**: Registration, Login, Logout.
- **Partner Management**: Search by exact username, send/accept/reject connection requests, multiple partners supported.
- **Real-time Interaction**: Click a button to send a thought, recipient sees the counter increase in real-time via WebSockets.
- **Instant Notifications**: Both sender and receiver get immediate notifications when thoughts are sent, including mood context.
- **Mood Support**: Optionally add a mood (happy, sad, angry, love, excited, worried, grateful, or neutral) to each thought.
- **Enhanced Statistics**: View click history over time (1, 7, 30 days) with adjustable granularity and mood distribution visualization.
- **Mood Analytics**: Stacked bar charts showing mood patterns and summary statistics for emotional insights.
- **Per-Connection Stats Switching**: Switch the statistics view between partners.
- **Last Mood Indicators**: See the most recent received and sent mood emoji per connection.
- **Dashboard Display Preference**: Switch dashboard cards between count totals and last event timestamp + emoji.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile with a burger menu and bottom tab navigation.

## Architecture
- **Backend**: Spring Boot (Java 21), Spring Security (JWT), Spring Data MongoDB, Spring WebSocket.
- **Frontend**: Vue 3 + TypeScript (Vite), Chart.js, SockJS, STOMP.
- **Database**: MongoDB.

## Quick Start (Docker Compose)

The easiest way to run the application locally is with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

That's it! The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

Docker Compose will automatically:
- Build and start the Spring Boot application
- Start a MongoDB database
- Connect the application to the database
- Handle all networking and data persistence

### Stopping the Application
```bash
docker compose down
```

### Development with Docker Compose
For development with hot reload:
```bash
docker compose up --build --watch
```

## Alternative: Manual Local Setup

If you prefer to run everything locally without Docker:

### Prerequisites
- Java 21
- MongoDB running locally
- Node.js 20+ (for frontend build/dev)

### Steps
1. **Start MongoDB** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongodb mongo:latest
   ```

2. **Run the Spring Boot application**:
   ```bash
   # Unix/Linux/MacOS
   ./gradlew bootRun
   
   # Windows
   gradlew.bat bootRun
   ```

3. **Access the application**:
   Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser

### Development Notes
- The Vue frontend uses Vite for hot reload and proxies API/WebSocket traffic
- Backend changes require a restart of the Spring Boot application
- Default MongoDB connection is to `localhost:27017`
- Access and refresh tokens are stored in localStorage for development

## Authentication and Session Lifecycle

The app uses short-lived access tokens plus long-lived refresh tokens.

- Access token: JWT used in `Authorization: Bearer ...` for API calls.
- Refresh token: opaque random token used to silently mint a new access token.
- Access token lifetime: 24 hours.
- Refresh token lifetime: 60 days.
- Refresh token rotation: every successful refresh returns a new refresh token and revokes the old one.
- Logout: revokes the current refresh token.
- Password change: revokes all active refresh tokens for that user.

### Client behavior
- On login, client stores `token`, `username`, and `refreshToken`.
- On app start, if only `refreshToken` is available, client calls `POST /api/auth/refresh` and restores session automatically.
- On `401`, client tries one silent refresh and retries the original request once before forcing login.
- Users can delete their account from the Profile screen by confirming their current password and username.

### Persistence compatibility
- Existing collections (`users`, `connections`, `thought_events`, etc.) are unchanged.
- Session persistence uses a new collection: `refresh_tokens`.
- No migration is required for existing databases.

### Frontend (Vue 3 + TypeScript)
The frontend source lives in `frontend/` and is built into `src/main/resources/static`.

#### Run frontend dev server (with backend running)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### Build frontend for Spring Boot
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
```

## Android (Capacitor)

This repo includes a Capacitor-based Android project under `frontend/android`.

### Quick Android build steps
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
npx cap sync android
npx cap open android
```

Notes:
- Android Studio is required to open and build the Android project.
- The Capacitor webDir is set to `../src/main/resources/static` to reuse the existing Vite output.
- If you change web assets, rerun `npm run build` and `npx cap sync android`.

### Android build modes

There are two distinct Android build modes:

1. Local Android mode
- Use this when the backend is running locally via `docker compose`.
- The Android emulator talks to the host machine through `http://10.0.2.2:8080`.
- Commands:
  ```bash
  docker compose up --build
  cd frontend
  npm install
  npm run build:android-local
  npm run android:sync
  npm run android:open
  ```
- PowerShell shortcut:
  ```powershell
  .\scripts\android-local.ps1
  ```

2. Railway Android mode
- Use this when the Android app should call the deployed Railway backend instead of your local machine.
- Create `frontend/.env.android-railway.local` based on `frontend/.env.android-railway.example` and set:
  ```bash
  VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://think-of-you-production.up.railway.app
  ```
- Then build and sync:
  ```bash
  cd frontend
  npm install
  npm run build:android-railway
  npm run android:sync
  npm run android:open
  ```
- PowerShell shortcut:
  ```powershell
  .\scripts\android-railway.ps1
  ```

Important:
- `docker-compose.yml` is only for the local backend stack.
- Railway deployment still uses the root `Dockerfile`.
- You do not need a second Docker Compose file just to switch Android between local and Railway.
- The Android app decides which backend to use at build time via the Vite mode and `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.
- Both PowerShell scripts also support `-SkipOpen` if you only want build + sync without opening Android Studio.

### Push notifications (FCM)
Client:
- Runtime permission is requested on Android 13+.
- The app registers the device token and calls `POST /api/push/register`.

Server:
- Set Firebase credentials with one of:
  - `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_BASE64` (base64 JSON)
  - `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH` (path to JSON)
  - `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` (fallback)
- For the Railway deployment, `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_BASE64` is the intended configuration path for server-side FCM sending.
- Place `google-services.json` at `frontend/android/app/google-services.json` (do not commit it).
  - Without this file, Android builds will work but push notifications will not.
  - For CI or hosts that only support environment variables, set `GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON_B64` and run:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run android:prepare-google-services
    ```
  - The script recreates `frontend/android/app/google-services.json` before the Android build.
- Background push notifications have been verified successfully against the Railway deployment.
